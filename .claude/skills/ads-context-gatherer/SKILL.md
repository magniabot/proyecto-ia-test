# Ads Context Gatherer

Gather brand and marketing context from a website URL. Outputs organized markdown files to a `context/` folder in the working directory for use as AI context in Google Ads work.

## Command Format

```
/ads-context-gatherer <URL> [--pages <paths>]
```

**Examples:**
- `/ads-context-gatherer https://acme.com` - Analyze homepage + auto-discover pages
- `/ads-context-gatherer https://acme.com --pages /about,/products,/contact` - Specific pages

**Defaults:**
- Pages: Homepage + auto-discovered from navigation (about, products, services, contact)

## Process

### Step 1: Parse Request

Extract from user input:
1. **Base URL** - The website domain (e.g., `https://acme.com`)
2. **Specific pages** - If provided via `--pages`, use those; otherwise auto-discover

**URL Validation:**
- Must start with `http://` or `https://`
- Extract base domain for page discovery
- If invalid, ask user to provide a valid URL

### Step 2: Fetch Homepage

Use WebFetch to retrieve the homepage:

```
WebFetch URL: {base_url}
Prompt: "Extract all text content from this page in its original language — do NOT translate anything. Include: main headings, paragraphs, navigation links, footer content. List all internal navigation links found. At the very end, state the primary language of the page content as a single line: DETECTED_LANGUAGE: {language code, e.g. en, de, nl, fr, es, ja}"
```

Save the navigation links for Step 3. Save the detected language (e.g., `de`, `nl`, `fr`) for use in Steps 4, 5, and 6. If detection is ambiguous, default to `en`.

### Step 3: Discover Additional Pages

From the homepage content, identify pages to analyze:

**Priority order:**
1. `/about` or `/about-us` - Company information
2. `/products` or `/services` - Offerings
3. `/contact` or `/contact-us` - Contact details
4. Any other prominent navigation links (max 15 additional pages)
5. Important to extract as much content as possible from each page to provide the best context for the brand.

If user specified `--pages`, use those instead of auto-discovery.

### Step 4: Fetch Additional Pages

For each discovered page, use WebFetch:

```
WebFetch URL: {base_url}{page_path}
Prompt: "Extract all text content from this page in its original language — do NOT translate anything. Include headings, paragraphs, lists, and any pricing or product information. Keep all text exactly as written on the page."
```

**Handle errors gracefully:**
- 404/not found: Skip and note in log
- Timeout: Retry once, then skip
- Blocked: Note in log, continue with available content

### Step 4.5: Extract Brand Colours (Chrome DevTools)

Use Chrome DevTools MCP to extract brand colours and fonts from the homepage. This step is **optional** — if Chrome DevTools is not available or extraction fails, skip gracefully and continue to Step 5.

#### 4.5.1 Navigate to Homepage

```
mcp__chrome-devtools__navigate_page → url: {base_url}, type: "url"
```

If navigation fails (Chrome not connected, timeout, error), log a warning and skip to Step 5.

#### 4.5.2 Dismiss Cookie/Consent Banner (best-effort)

Many sites show a cookie/consent banner that overlays the hero on first load. If left in place, both the screenshot and the CSS colour extraction are degraded and the real primary brand colour can be missed.

1. **Take a screenshot** of the loaded homepage (`mcp__chrome-devtools__take_screenshot`) and visually check whether a cookie/consent banner is covering the hero.
2. **If a banner is present, dismiss it** by clicking its accept-all button. Take a snapshot (`mcp__chrome-devtools__take_snapshot`) to locate the control, then `mcp__chrome-devtools__click` it. Look for the common consent-management buttons and, as a fallback, any visible button whose text means accept/agree **in the site's language** (detected in Step 2).
3. **Wait ~500ms** for the banner to disappear, then **take a second screenshot** to confirm the hero is now visible.

This step is **best-effort and non-blocking**: if no banner is found, or it can't be dismissed, log it and continue to extraction anyway.

#### 4.5.3 Extract Colours and Fonts

Read the JavaScript function from `references/colour-extraction-script.md` and execute it:

```
mcp__chrome-devtools__evaluate_script → function: <script from reference file>
```

The script returns `{colors: [...], fonts: {heading, body}}` with frequency counts and context tags.

If execution fails, log a warning and skip to Step 5.

#### 4.5.4 Process Results

1. **Convert RGB to hex** — e.g., `rgb(26, 26, 46)` → `#1a1a2e`
2. **Filter out** transparent, pure white (`#ffffff`), and pure black (`#000000`)
3. **Keep top 10** colours by frequency
4. **Assign colour roles** based on context tags:

| Role | Assignment Rule |
|------|----------------|
| Primary | Highest-frequency colour with `navigation-bg` or `h1-text` context |
| Accent | Highest-frequency colour with `cta-bg` context |
| Background | Colour with `body-bg` context |
| Text | Colour with `body-text` context |
| Link | Colour with `link-text` context |

If a role can't be assigned from context, fall back to frequency order (skip colours already assigned).

#### 4.5.5 Visual Verification

**Compare the script results against the screenshot.** You can see the site — use your eyes.

Take a screenshot of the page to verify visually the extracted data.

Check for each role:
- **Primary**: Does the extracted primary match the dominant brand colour visible in the header, nav, or hero? If the script says `#333333` but you can clearly see a teal or blue header, the script missed it.
- **Accent**: Does the extracted accent match the CTA button colour visible on the page? If the script returned nothing but you can see coloured buttons, fill it in.
- **Background/Text**: These are usually correct from the script.

**If the script results look wrong or incomplete:**
1. Identify the correct colours visually from the screenshot
2. Run a targeted extraction script for the specific element to get exact hex values:
   ```
   mcp__chrome-devtools__evaluate_script → function: () => {
       const el = document.querySelector('<selector>');
       const style = getComputedStyle(el);
       return {
           bg: style.backgroundColor,
           bgImage: style.backgroundImage,
           color: style.color
       };
   }
   ```
3. Override the script's role assignments with what you can visually confirm

The script is a starting point. Your visual judgement is the final authority on what the brand colours actually are.

#### 4.5.6 Write Palette File

Create `context/brand-colours/` directory if it doesn't exist.

Write `context/brand-colours/palette.md` using the template from `references/palette-output-template.md`, populated with:
- Colour table (hex, RGB, contexts, frequency)
- Typography (heading/body fonts)
- Suggested colour roles with rationale
- Usage recommendations for Google Ads, landing pages, display ads

#### 4.5.7 Error Handling

This step must **never** block the skill. On any failure:

| Failure | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Chrome DevTools not connected | Log warning, skip entire step |
| Navigation fails | Log error, skip to Step 5 |
| Consent banner not found or can't be dismissed | Log it, continue to extraction anyway |
| JS execution fails | Log error, skip to Step 5 |
| No meaningful colours found | Write minimal `palette.md` noting manual identification needed |

Log all outcomes for Step 7 summary.

### Step 5: Extract Brand Context

Combine all fetched page content and analyze using the prompt from `references/brand-extraction-prompt.md`.

Read the prompt file, insert the scraped content and the detected language from Step 2 into the `{detected_language}` placeholder, and generate structured brand analysis covering:
- Company overview
- Tone of voice
- Target audience
- Products/services
- USPs and trust signals
- CTAs

### Step 6: Generate Output Files

Create the following structure in the working directory:

```
context/
├── brand.md              # Full brand analysis
├── business.md           # Business context template (if doesn't exist)
├── brand-colours/
│   └── palette.md        # Brand colour palette (if Chrome DevTools available)
├── website/
│   └── pages/
│       ├── homepage.md   # Homepage content
│       ├── about.md      # About page (if found)
│       └── {page}.md     # Other pages
└── .logs/
    └── {YYYY-MM-DD}.log  # Execution log
```

### Step 6.5: Generate Business Context Template

**Check if `context/business.md` exists:**

- **If exists:** Do not overwrite, note status as "Business context configured"
- **If not exists:** Create template file from `context/business.md` template

**Template to create** (if business.md doesn't exist):

```markdown
# Business Context

| [Extracted / Skipped / Partial] | [e.g., "10 colours extracted, 5 roles assigned" / "Chrome DevTools not available" / "Extraction failed, manual identification needed"] |

**If extracted:**
> Brand colours saved to `context/brand-colours/palette.md` with {n} colours and suggested roles.
> The landing-page-builder and other skills will use this palette automatically.

**If skipped:**
> Colour extraction requires Chrome DevTools MCP. Open Chrome and ensure the DevTools MCP server is connected, then re-run `/ads-context` to extract colours. This is optional — all other context was gathered successfully.

### Business Context Status

| File | Status | Action Needed |
|------|--------|---------------|
| context/business.md | [Created template / Already configured / Missing] | [Fill in template / Ready to use / Create manually] |

**If template created:**
> A business context template has been created at `context/business.md`.
> Fill in your business goals, targets, and constraints to enable:
> - Performance vs. target tracking in `/gads-context`
> - Priority-based analysis in QS agents
> - Constraint-aware recommendations
> - Competitive strategy integration

**If already configured:**
> Business context is configured and will be used by all agents and skills.
